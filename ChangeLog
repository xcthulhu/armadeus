  - uClibc-0.9.29 pretends that spinclocks are available  ("#define _POSIX_SPIN_LOCKS" in posix_opt.h) whereas for ARM, this functionality is currently in development. As a consequence, third party applications looking for this define to internally enable spinlocking  may fail to compile. (As "clocktest" provided by Xenomai). This patch inhibits the faulty define. Thanks Creber
