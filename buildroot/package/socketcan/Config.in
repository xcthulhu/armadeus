	  The socketcan package is an implementation of CAN protocols
	  (Controller Area Network) for Linux.  CAN is a networking technology
	  which has wide-spread use in automation, embedded devices, and
	  automotive fields.

	  While there have been other CAN implementations for Linux based on 
	  character devices, Socket CAN uses the Berkeley socket API, 
	  the Linux network stack and implements the CAN device drivers as 
	  network interfaces.  The CAN socket API has been designed as similar
	  as possible to the TCP/IP protocols to allow programmers, familiar 
	  with network programming, to easily learn how to use CAN sockets.
